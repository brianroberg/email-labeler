    Blame by correlation, cycle-level:

      * A candidate failure (Timeout / RuntimeError / unexpected Exception)
        counts a strike iff its signature is unique among the cycle's candidate
        failures AND — when other threads ATTEMPTED work this cycle — at least
        one of them was handled successfully. Everything else is treated as
        shared cause (provider, proxy, disk, or our own config/code): no
        strikes, one ERROR line, backlog kept.
      * The correlation denominator is the threads that attempted work, not
        every thread the cycle fetched: only a thread that succeeded or
        recorded a failure is evidence about anything. Threads that merely
        DEFERRED — their function halted, the local tier offline, a
        NEWSLETTER_ONLY skip, a 403-rejected write, an assessment-sink fault —
        tried nothing and committed nothing, so they neither blame nor absolve.
      * A singleton cycle counts: with no attempting siblings to correlate
        against, bounded strikes to a findable agent/attempted is the honest
        fallback — and the poison-thread case is typically a singleton
        (everything else processed away).
      * Provider-shaped failures never strike. When exactly one thread failed
        provider-shaped and a sibling succeeded, its masquerade counter
        advances (see MasqueradeTracker); ambiguous cycles (singleton,
        zero-success) leave the counter untouched.

    Fetches the full thread, formats all messages into a transcript,
    classifies once, and applies labels to all messages in the thread.
    A classification whose label write failed in a prior cycle is reused from
    result_cache (issue #29) instead of being re-run, as long as the thread's
    message ids are unchanged.

    Uses semaphores to bound concurrent LLM requests:
    - cloud_sem: acquired for Stage 1 (sender classification) and Stage 2 SERVICE emails
    - local_sem: acquired for Stage 2 PERSON emails (local MLX LLM)

    If the local LLM is unreachable, ConnectError is raised immediately.
    If it times out (e.g. model loading), the configured timeout applies.

    Enforces no-downgrade rule: if the thread already has a classification
    with equal or higher priority, it is skipped.

    Failures are never handled inline (decision D5): each failure arm records a
    CycleFailure into ``cycle_failures`` — candidate or provider-shaped — and
    returns False; the poll loop's post-gather attribution step decides strikes
    and marking (attribute_cycle_failures). Three arms deliberately record no
    CycleFailure, for three different reasons: the assessment-sink arm
    (AssessmentSinkError), because a sink fault is shared-cause by construction
    (the disk, not the thread) — nothing for correlation to weigh, retried
    forever; the proxy-403 arm (ProxyForbiddenError), because a rejected write
    is a human answer rather than a failure (decision D6) and is simply
    re-offered; and a LOCAL-tier LLMUnavailableError, a routine deferral
    counted in ``local_deferrals`` for the per-cycle summary instead (issue
    #24).

    Halts are per-function (decision D5's scope rule, D19): a balance fault
    trips only the halted function's slot in ``halts``, and a thread whose own
    function is halted defers (returns False) without a CycleFailure — a halt
    is a deferral, not a failure to attribute.

    Args:
        thread_id: Gmail thread ID.
        msg_ids: List of message IDs in the thread (from list_messages stubs).
