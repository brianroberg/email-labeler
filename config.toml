- SERVICE: An automated email, newsletter, marketing, notification, receipt, shipping update, social media notification, or any email from a company/service

- NEEDS_RESPONSE: The email requires a reply or action from the recipient. Questions directed at you, meeting requests, invitations needing RSVP, requests for information.
- FYI: The email is informational and worth reading but requires no action. Status updates from people, shared articles from contacts, announcements you should know about.
- LOW_PRIORITY: The email has low importance. Marketing newsletters you subscribed to, routine automated notifications, social media digests, promotional offers you might occasionally want.
- UNWANTED: The email is unwanted. Spam, unsolicited marketing, emails from senders you don't recognize with no value, phishing attempts, repeated promotional emails.
